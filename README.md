## 🧱 Project Structure

```
YB-Login-Page/
│
├── index.html     # Main HTML file (Login & Register page)
├── style.css      # Styling and animations
└── script.js      # JavaScript for toggling forms
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **Login** and **Register** forms are placed side by side in the same container.
2. Clicking **"Sign Up"** adds an `active` class to the container which triggers CSS animations to slide between forms.
3. Clicking **"Sign In"** removes the `active` class to return to the login form.
4. The curved shapes animate and transform smoothly using CSS transitions.
